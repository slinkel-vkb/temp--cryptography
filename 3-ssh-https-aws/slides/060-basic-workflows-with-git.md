# Basic Workflows with Git

## obtain a repository to work with

- `git clone` for repositories that already exist on a remote
  - like `svn checkout` but copies the entire history instead of just the latest revision of the files

- `git init` for creating a new repository
  - has no equivalent in svn because svn has no local repositories
