# Implementing Git Workflows using Pull Requests

## Feature Branching

- main branch is center of development
  - every commit in main should be deployable
- one branch per feature
- before merging into main a feature must be
  - self contained
  - completed
  - well tested
- cannot commit into main directly (branch protection!)
