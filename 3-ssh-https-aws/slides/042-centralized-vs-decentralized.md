# centralized vs decentralized

## decentralized

- usually uses one server the developers communicate their changes over, called "origin"
- every developer gets a local copy of the entire history of the repository
- commits can be done locally and offline
- committing a change does **not** mean to immediately publish those changes
- commits must be pushed to the origin eventually for other developers to fetch these changes
- conflicts will be resolved locally after fetching an update from origin
