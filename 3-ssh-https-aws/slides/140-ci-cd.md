# CI/CD

## GitHub Actions

- GitHub provides a run time called github actions with which code can be executed against your repository on specified events

- these events include:
  - pushing a commit
  - creating a pull request
  - updating an existing pull request
  - closing an pull request
  - ...

- can be used to run CI tasks automatically

- in conjunction with branch protection it can be used to enforce certain conditions (i.e. running tests) for code to be merged in to certain branches.
