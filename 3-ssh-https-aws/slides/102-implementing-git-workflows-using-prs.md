# Implementing Git Workflows using Pull Requests

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Feature Branching

- even though code will be well tested, bugs tend to slip through to production due to the closeness of feature branches to the main branch

- fastest feedback loop possible

- easiest to keep dependencies up to date

- tends to make developers more conscious about what they push, because everything is published pretty much immediately

### Gitflow

- code tends to be more staple when eventually released to production

- slower feedback loops

- develop branch gives a possibility to deploy a staging version non-technical users of a firm can easily use and give feedback on
