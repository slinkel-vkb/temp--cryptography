# Integrate Issue Tracking to your Github Workflow

- one issue should be resolvable in one pull request
  - one feature/fix per issue
  - split large features into smaller ones
  - it is fine for a pull request to contain "unused" but well tested code, if a feature does not making sense without another unreleased/planned feature

- in GitHub for larger overarching goals milestones or project boards can be used

- in GitHub pull requests can be linked to issues to close them automatically
